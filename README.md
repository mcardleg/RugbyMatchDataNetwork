# RugbyMatchDataNetwork
Networking of devices that collect data on rugby players during a match. Packaging and transmission of data.

 This is a college project by two third year Computer Engineering students, at Trinity College Dublin. This is for our Computer Networking module. We do not have access to the necessary devices, as such this project will be a simulation.
 
 Our brief was quite open, but we decided to focus on athlete data transmission during rugby matches. We are networking the coaches' computers with devices that are gathering data on each player.
